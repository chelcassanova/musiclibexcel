*I want the script (or program) to create a file with the music folders as worksheets, be able to 
fill each sheet with its respective folder's music files' information, and verify any additions to 
or removals from the worksheet.

The creating part is down in one file, but should everything be linked together using classes and executed in one
program with a simple GUI?
