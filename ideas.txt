*I want the script (or program) to create a file with the music folders as worksheets, be able to 
fill each sheet with its respective folder's music files' information, and verify any additions to 
or removals from the worksheet.

The creating part is down in one file, but should everything be linked together using classes and executed in one
program with a simple GUI?

NEW IDEAS
---------------------------------------------
Instead of using an Excel sheet, use an actual database
Connect this database with my Spotify account

1. Place all the music info into a db file, start here
2. Use Spotipy at some point
