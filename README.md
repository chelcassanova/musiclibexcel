I used to store all of my local music files on the SD Card on my phone. One day, a single 0 byte file corrupted the entire card, and I lost all of my music.

I was pretty upset, and decided that if this ever happened to me again, I'd want a record of all the music I had in a database of sorts, so I made this program! <sub><sup>I also finally started paying for Spotify after 2 years of being cheap.</sup></sub>

Originally, this was a script that recorded my entire music library in an Excel spreadsheet. It's currently being modified to use SQL instead.
